#User Message Service
This service allows to implement user oriented messaging. It relies on a simple function that will add a message with a given level, and an HTML block that will render user's messages when the page is loaded.

##Using the Service
When the package is installed, a block is added to the template's header. When rendered, this block will dump the messages that were stored into the session.

Add a message :
```php
set_user_message("User <b>foo bar</b> has been successfully cerated", UserMessageInterface::SUCCESS);
```
The ```php UserMessageInterface Interface ``` defines 4 types of message :

 * SUCCESS
 * INFO
 * WARNING
 * ERROR
 
By default, the message will be displayed in the header block. But you are free to insert this block anywhere.
